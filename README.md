Arron Ollington - Handcrafted Projects (Under Construction)

This is a simple one-page 'under construction' landing page, which is created for a Freelance Event and Project Manager in Melbourne Australia.

The purpose for the site is to create a brand identity and awareness for the client, which will be mirrored in the final site (to be built on the Wordpress CMS).
The site is to also to be used for its contact form.

Primarily written as a static HTML5 and CSS3 (validated) site,
jQuery is used to drop the form down and pick the form up,
and the PHP Mail function is used to send the post data from the form to the client.

The site can be found at [http://www.arronollington.com.au] (http://www.arronollington.com.au "Arron Ollington - Handcrafted Projects")
